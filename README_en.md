## Create your own Macsen

Along with the app's code, all of Macsen's components for speech and linguistic artificial intelligence technology 
are open source and permissevely licensed for use by other developers. Documentation on Macsen's software and how to 
adapt, expand and develop your own Macsen can be found in [docs/README_en.md](docs/README_en.md). 

In the meantime, we are doing further research and development to improve it, and to enable Macsen in other 
situations. 


## Acknowlegements

Work on Macsen has been funded by the Welsh Government. 

However, Macsen would not be possible without the work of other open source projects and communities. We’d like to thank 
Mozilla for its speech technologies and their excellent [CommonVoice speech data crowdsourcing website](https://commonvoice.mozilla.org/cy)
and [DeepSpeech speech recognition library](https://github.com/mozilla/deepspeech). They simply rock. 

Macsen’s intent parsing is based on [MyCroft’s Padatious library](https://mycroft-ai.gitbook.io/docs/mycroft-technologies/padatious) 
while provision of open source text-to-speech is due to [MaryTTS](https://github.com/marytts/marytts)

We’d like to give a huge thanks to all the volunteers who have contributed their voices via the CommonVoice website and/or 
the Macsen app for enabling Welsh speech technology. We would like to thank S4C, Golwg360 (the Welsh language website),
Welsh Wikipedia volunteers and the wider Welsh speaking community for their support of Macsen.
